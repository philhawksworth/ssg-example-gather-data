Then call backend server routes via http requests and make this work. But this may leads to backend routes vulnerable (as they are not protected) . This is not an issue for me as I'm not storing users secret info.  Can anyone tell me whether my understanding is correct or not ? And what is the easiest method to authenticate users in my app ? Any help would be appreciated ?    submitted by    /u/sp3co92   [link]   [comments]","id":"t3_8w03ho"},{"title":"Tips on Creating Reusable Components","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8w0zil/tips_on_creating_reusable_components/","pubDate":"2018-07-04T11:37:31.000Z","author":"/u/fagnerbrack","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8w0zil/tips_on_creating_reusable_components/\"> <img src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7czx6ZyzImxfhLhNHV2c75OFK0NijwsFEJWqeZI1tq8.jpg\" alt=\"Tips on Creating Reusable Components\" title=\"Tips on Creating Reusable Components\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fagnerbrack\"> /u/fagnerbrack </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://dev.to/ganderzz/tips-on-creating-reusable-components-376j\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8w0zil/tips_on_creating_reusable_components/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","contentSnippet":"submitted by    /u/fagnerbrack   [link]   [comments]","id":"t3_8w0zil"},{"title":"Clean Code saves Devs. The Caffeina approach to ReactJS","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8w0w3d/clean_code_saves_devs_the_caffeina_approach_to/","pubDate":"2018-07-04T11:19:25.000Z","author":"/u/thecreazy","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8w0w3d/clean_code_saves_devs_the_caffeina_approach_to/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Z_5grL3Bo2oUTAiJx3rHRoKwpT8TPcaOPidDZBHxTdQ.jpg\" alt=\"Clean Code saves Devs. The Caffeina approach to ReactJS\" title=\"Clean Code saves Devs. The Caffeina approach to ReactJS\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thecreazy\"> /u/thecreazy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://developers.caffeina.com/clean-code-saves-devs-the-caffeina-approach-to-reactjs-1b56ad15aa64\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8w0w3d/clean_code_saves_devs_the_caffeina_approach_to/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","contentSnippet":"submitted by    /u/thecreazy   [link]   [comments]","id":"t3_8w0w3d"},{"title":"Does anyone know any good vanilla javascript projects that are worth while to look through to learn how people code?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8w0s58/does_anyone_know_any_good_vanilla_javascript/","pubDate":"2018-07-04T10:58:41.000Z","author":"/u/Archikus","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Wassup my fellow web dudes.</p> <p>Been wondering if anyone would have some good Vanilla javascript projects/websites/plugins/apps that implement good JS practices to look at how different problems are solved by different people?</p> <p>Cheers</p> <p>Happy Coding</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Archikus\"> /u/Archikus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8w0s58/does_anyone_know_any_good_vanilla_javascript/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8w0s58/does_anyone_know_any_good_vanilla_javascript/\">[comments]</a></span>","contentSnippet":"Wassup my fellow web dudes.
